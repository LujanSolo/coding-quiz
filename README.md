DEPLOYED SITE LINK:

A basic box quiz with multiple choice answers all centered around the topic of coding. The application pushes questions and answers directly from javaScript to the index.

The coder's hope was to challenge their understanding of javaScript, proper function design, and workflow theories. 

## Usage

To begin the game, press the "BEGIN!" button at the opening screen. Read the questions and try to answer correctly, as incorrect answers will deduct 10 seconds from the starting timer.
